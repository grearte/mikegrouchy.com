## Get a version of vim that supports python

First step is test if your vim version was compiled with python support.


{% syntax python %}
    :python import sys; print sys.version
{% endsyntax %}

MacVim on OSX and Gvim on windows should be compiled with python support by default.
If you don't have compiled python support you should probably recompile vim with +python
or get a copy of MacVim or Gvim.

## Install terminal Vim on OSX with homebrew (optional)
If you want to use the terminal Vim on OSX, you can compile it with homebrew
with this script

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2051422.js?file=vim.rb"></script>

To install with this script you will need to install mercurial

easy_install mercurial
or
pip install mercurial

brew install https://raw.github.com/gist/2051422/6b9f33b7135f44e3e55af6e15ed32b738de2f666/vim.rb

## Basic .vimrc setup (optional)
First get good basic settings in your .vimrc. You can ignore this if you
already have a vimrc you like.

{% syntax vim %}
" Default to act like vim, not vi
set nocompatible
" Turn on line numbers
set number
set numberwidth=5
" utf8 incoding
set encoding=utf8
" smart indentation overriden by individual filetype settings
set smartindent
" show matching braces, brackets and such
set showmatch
" Turn off beeping and visual bells
set vb t_vb=
" incremental search
set incsearch
" show status line even when only one window is shown.
set ls=2
" show the current position (line+col) and percentage in buffer
set ruler
" don't distinguish between caps in search
set ignorecase
" set window title
set title
" fast terminal connection
set ttyfast
" set up tabs and indentation, default to 4 space tabs. We don't actually use
" tabs here. This is overwritten in individual syntax files
set shiftwidth=4
set tabstop=4
syntax on "syntax highlighting
" While typing a search command, show where the pattern matches
setlocal incsearch
" When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches
setlocal hlsearch
{% endsyntax %}

## Python Specific .vimrc settings
Now lets set up some basic python vimrc settings. We won't have many because we
will use vim plugins for the more advanced settings.
{% syntax vim %}
" Enable file type detection
filetype plugin indent on
"python autocomplete
au FileType python set omnifunc=pythoncomplete#Complete
set completeopt=menuone,longest,preview
{% endsyntax %}

Not too many python specific setting there, as I said, most python specific
functionality will be provided by plugins.

## Plugins
I use [Tim Popes](http://twitter.com/tpope) excellent [Pathogen](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to
manage plugins. To get pathogen installed you can just run this command
{% syntax bash %}
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle;
curl -so ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/HEAD/autoload/pathogen.vim
{% endsyntax %}
