title: A New Blog A New Beginning

So as you can tell this all looks a bit different. This blog that you are currently
reading is __completely static__. All of this post content is actually written in
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and then generated as static html by
[Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/). As you can tell some of the css is off and
this blog isn't overly full featured. I'm considering this a work in process and
a little project to import my css skills as well as a fun little thing I can work
on, on the side.  I will probably write a post about how to get started with hyde
for people interested in trying it out.

I decided that with this new blog its a completely fresh start, I haven't carried
over any of the old posts from my old blog and I could care less about the google
juice I am losing because of that. In this new incarnation of the blog, I'm hoping
I will post a little more consistently as well as bring a tighter focus. I have
had [mikegrouchy.com](http://mikegrouchy.com) for 6 years and it has
been a blog that entire time, but there hasn't been a lot of great content. I plan
on bringing back some of my old tutorial posts that people used ,
but probably update them a bit which hopefully will be an improvement.
