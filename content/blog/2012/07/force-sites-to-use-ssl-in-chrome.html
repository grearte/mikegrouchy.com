I saw this tip in the comments over at [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) today
and I thought that this is a great alternative to force SSL for sites that don't have
it available.

##Step 1
Navigate to Chrome's net internals dashboard by typing

`chrome://net-internals/` into your browser.

You should see:

##Step 2
Navigate to the [HSTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)(HTTPS Strict Transport Security) Tab and you should see this:

##Step 3
From there its pretty easy, just type in the site you want to force to SSL and
you are done!

Do you have any other Chrome security tips? Leave them in the comments!
