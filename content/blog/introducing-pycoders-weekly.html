The last couple of weeks [Mahdi Yusuf](http://mahdiyusuf.com) and I have been talking
about the python newsletter that we would want to recieve weekly. A curated
collection of the best python news, articles and projects from around the internet
delivered to your inbox in a beautiful package weekly.

The result of this talk has been [Pycoders Weekly](http://pycoders.com).
The first issue is set to drop on Friday, February 17th, we hope you like it.
