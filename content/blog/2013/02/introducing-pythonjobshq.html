As you may know if you have read this blog, I am one of the curators for [Pycoder's Weekly](http://pycoders.com).
We have been working on a bunch of small projects to try to bring more value from Pycoder's
into the python community. The first thing we have launched this year is [Python Jobs HQ](http://pythonjobshq.com).

[Python Jobs HQ](http://pythonjobshq.com) is a Job site we are running that is focused on
putting the best jobs in front of the best people. Jobs posted on the site are posted to
the [@pycoders](http://twitter.com/pycoders) fast growing Twitter account and the Job Board
is advertised weekly in the newsletter. Already we have had great companies like [Newsle](http://newsle.com), [Path](http://path.com)
[Datadoghq](http://datadoghq.com) and [Cyan Inc](http://cyaninc.com). and others post with us. If you have a Python Job to post
for your company or f you are looking to find a new job as a Python Developer,
you should check out [Python Jobs HQ](http://pythonjobshq.com).

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mgrouchy) or email our [Pycoder's Email](mailto:admin@pycoders.com).
