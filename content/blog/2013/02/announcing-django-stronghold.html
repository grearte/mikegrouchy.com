I spent much of last year trying to turn up my Open Source contributions
so I spent much of my time contibuting to other peoples Open Source Projects. Its
2013 and its a new year, so I am making a push to get some Open Source projects
that I have had in the pipe actually out there in the wild. The first of these is
[django-stronghold](http://github.com/mgrouchy/django-stronghold). If you are a Django developer and
you have worked on a Django project of any size, you might have coded something
like this already which makes it the perfect target for open source.

[Django-Stronghold](http://github.com/mgrouchy/django-stronghold) defaults your Django project to private. This means that via
some middleware all your Django Views become `login_required`. Stronghold also
provides some mechanisims to make views public via a decorator or whitelisting
some of your url patterns. Either way, if this sounds useful to you [check out the
repo](http://github.com/mgrouchy/django-stronghold), install it and report any issues you run into.

Shout out to [Richard Blair](http://twitter.com/richardlblair) for help with this.
